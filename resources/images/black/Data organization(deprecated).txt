--Our work--
Each card has a name based on numbers (i.e. "0.png") and the calculation of those names are organised in such a mathematic pattern thought as it follows:

wild			: 14*(1-2-3-4)
wild draw 4		: 14*(5-6-7-8)
blank cards		: 57-71-85-99

0-9			: 1-10     + 14*color
skip-reverse-draw	: 11-12-13 + 14*color
1-9			: 58-66    + 14*color
skip-reverse-draw	: 67-68-69 + 14*color
color legend : R:0 - Y:1 - G:2 - B:3
